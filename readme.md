This is a simple python program which converts a bunch of images into a single PDF file. You just need to specify the path to the directory of images, everything else would be handled by the program.

> `PATH = 'path/to/images'`

Just replace _path/to/images_ with the path to the directory of images.

You can find the output file, called output.pdf, in the same directory where all your images are present.
